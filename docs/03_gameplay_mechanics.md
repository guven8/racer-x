### Core Loop (Open‑World)

- Set a waypoint and drive—discover **activities** embedded on roads.
- Earn scores (3‑star targets) for speed traps, drift zones, and clean time sections.
- Traffic density slider; optional damage off for chill mode.

### Camera

- Chase camera with spring‑arm and velocity‑aligned yaw; cockpit/bumper optional.

### Handling Model (RX‑01)

- As before: semi‑slicks μ≈1.1, RWD, assists optional.

### Traffic AI

- Graph following with lane offsets and stochastic headway.
- Yield at intersections; simple avoidance bubble around player.
- Time‑of‑day density curves (later).

### Activities

- **Speed Trap**: peak kph through gate → stars/leaderboard.
- **Drift Zone**: cumulative slip angle \* speed score.
- **Time Section**: rolling start to finish gate on public road.

### Penalties

- Short off‑road = score decay; long cut = invalid run.
