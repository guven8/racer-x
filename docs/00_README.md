### Vision

Racer‑X is now **open‑world first**: a seamless driving sandbox with believable physics, traffic, and discovery. Think "Sunday drive meets driving school"—cruise, practice car control, complete skill challenges, and chase PBs on road segments. Racing modes arrive later as events layered onto the same world.

### North Stars

- **Feel first**: input latency, camera, FFB, and sound matter as much as visuals.
- **Fast loads**: <3s first play on a 50Mbps connection; incremental caching thereafter.
- **Scalable fidelity**: visual/physics LODs to run from low-end laptops to gaming rigs (WebGPU→WebGL2 fallback).
- **Moddable**: GLTF2 + KTX2 assets; JSON tuning sheets; no engine recompile to add cars/tracks.

### MVP Scope (Milestone M1)

- One drivable car (“RX‑01”) with RWD ~220hp.
- **One contiguous open map (~4×4 km)** with highways, B‑roads, small town hub, and a service area.
- **Streaming world** with cells/tiles and impostor LODs; day/overcast lighting preset.
- **Traffic v0**: simple AI vehicles on spline graph with obey/ignore variance.
- **Activities**: speed traps, drift zones, time trials on marked road segments.
- **Navigation**: minimap + GPS line to waypoint; free cam photo mode.
- Keyboard + Gamepad; 60 FPS target at 1080p on mid‑tier laptop.

### Stretch (M2–M3)

- Replays and leaderboards per activity.
- Racing events on temporary barriers using existing roads.
- Basic economy (credits) and garage fast‑travel.
- Weather presets (rain, night) + headlights/taillights.
- Online freeroam (4–8 players) with convoys and synced traffic.
- Replays, time attack leaderboards, split times.
- Online multiplayer (unranked) with 4–8 players.
- Garage UI, basic liveries, car setups.
